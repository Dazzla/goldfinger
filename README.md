_Because silence is golden_

Thanks to Zetetic of http://www.cookdandbomd.co.uk who wrote the cab_ignore_usr.js,
 which is about 98% of the total effort. I just bunged it into a Chrome extension.

**Instructions for use**

1. Chrome extension:

   * Chrome Extension web page at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goldfinger/lcblhgagcoikoioafdifjkpmhpdpengc
   
   Otherwise, you can directly install the CRX:

2. Make sure it's enabled in chrome:extensions

3. Visit the user page of the scrote whose whining troubles you and click 'Ignore User'

4. That's it.



**TODO**

* Make block time configurable
* On\off switch
